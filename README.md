## 🎨 Theming

This project supports:
- Light/Dark mode toggle via the “🌙/☀️” button
- Accent color themes via an attribute on `<html>`

Supported accents: `rose`, `amber`, `emerald`, `sky`, `violet`, `fuchsia`

Set the accent in your HTML tag:
```html
<html lang="en" data-accent="violet">

You can also set dark mode by default:

<html lang="en" data-accent="emerald" data-theme="dark">


Tip: You can wire a dropdown to change document.documentElement.dataset.accent at runtime for a theme picker.

🔗 Shareable Links

The app syncs your input to the URL:

dob=YYYY-MM-DD
t=HH:MM
live=1 to enable live mode
usebt=0 to disable “use birth time”
Example:

https://your-domain.tld/?dob=1998-04-20&t=06:30&live=1


Use the “🔗 Share” button to copy the current link.

🛠️ How It Works

Time math
Uses native Date with careful calendar math for years/months/days
Leap years and Feb 29 birthdays are handled (next birthday shifts to Feb 28 on non-leap years)
Next birthday progress
Calculates time since last birthday vs the current birthday interval for a smooth progress indicator
Performance
Live mode updates once per second with minimal DOM work

♿ Accessibility

Proper labels and descriptions for inputs
Keyboard-friendly focus styles
Reduced motion honored (prefers-reduced-motion)
Clear error messages via ARIA live regions

🌍 Browser Support

Modern evergreen browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari)
Mobile-first responsive layout
No external dependencies required

💡 Tips

Want a different vibe? Try:
<html data-accent="rose"> for a rose/coral look
<html data-accent="fuchsia"> for neon magenta
<html data-accent="emerald"> for a calm green-cyan blend
Prefer minimal motion? Your OS reduced-motion preference is respected automatically.
Enjoy your new, beautiful Age Calculator! 🎂✨
